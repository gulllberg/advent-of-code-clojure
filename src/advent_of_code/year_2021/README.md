# 2021

I was getting a bit worn out towards the end of the month, and when I saw day 19 it reminded me of the sea monsters problem from last year.
Remembering how long that one took me to solve I ignored that day. Some other tough problems towards the end also remain unsolved.

During December, I got 43 stars, missing Day 19, 24, 25 and 22 part 2.
