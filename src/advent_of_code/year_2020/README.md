# 2020

This year will always hold a special place in my heart. It was the first year I managed to finish. It was also the year I discovered the reddit community.

Some problems were very satisfying to solve. I remember spending the better part of a day during a weekend to solve the sea monsters puzzle.
I also remember being happy with solving the buses problem "with logic and maths" and then going on reddit to see people talking about the Chinese Remainder Theorem,
which I had never heard of.

Looking back at the "solutions" there are several days which are a mix of coding and manual work towards the end or in the start.

I had thought that the difficulty would continue to ramp up throughout the entire event, and considering how difficult the problems
were getting around day 20 I thought that the end would be brutal. I was pleasantly surprised that the ones over Christmas were quite friendly.

I actually finished for once!

Some solutions are a bit messy, but oh well...
