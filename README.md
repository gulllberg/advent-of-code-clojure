# Advent of Code

I love clojure as a language, but most of my professional work has been in other languages.
AoC has often been my "happy place" once a year, where I get to work in clojure for a month.
I also love the puzzles, story and community on reddit.

I was introduced to it at work in 2017, and did a few days that year and the next.
Then in 2020 I completed my first full year (after missing 2019 completely). It was a turbulent time for me, and it was great to have something else to focus on.
I'm sure it also helped that I was more experienced to tackle the harder problems.

Since then, I have completed most or all of the puzzles during December.

I mostly don't go back to days I have already solved. Keeping them as they were is in my opinion interesting for historical reasons.
Some days have been improved, that's typically seen in the git history.

I previously had one repo per year, but I will collect them all here.
Maybe this will encourage me to go back and complete some previous days and years. I would also like to create a library of helper functions for things that are often done,
and also higher-order versions of algorithms such as a-star. (Although this will mean that some of the git history gets lost.)
