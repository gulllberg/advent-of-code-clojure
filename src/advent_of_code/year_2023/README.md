# 2023

In my opinion, this was a great and quite challenging year. There were several days that were interesting from an algorithmic and mathematical point of view.
I learned several new concepts (e.g. Shoelace formula, graph stuff with Karger).

The difficulty, especially the very last days, felt higher than previous years. I'm happy I managed to finish everything in December.
This was the first year I went to England to celebrate Christmas with my (now) wife's family. I feel like I spent most of it thinking about AoC problems...

Some days were done in group with colleagues. Some of my own solutions are a bit messy, and a mix of coding and maths/observations on the problem (e.g. Day 24).
And let's not talk about Day 5 :)
