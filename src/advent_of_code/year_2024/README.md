# 2024

This was a great year! Some very fun days, with the "find a Christmas tree", "build your own computer" and "recursive keypads" coming to mind.
The difficulty felt lower than last year. Many problems were solved with Tomas and other colleagues.
And I got around to doing my first visualisation, which was fun!
