# 2015

I did this year during approximately 10 days in May 2025. I had just moved abroad, and it was great to have some coding problems to do whilst waiting for my work permit to be approved.

It was interesting to go back to the first year of AoC a decade after it was created. I was struck by how similar it felt to later years, meaning it was great from the beginning! You can see that some things have changed slightly over the years, particularly with providing more test cases in the problem statement.

Quite early in the month my solutions ran a bit slowly (e.g. Day 6), and it felt like not the easiest start to a year. But then it felt like the difficulty plateaued (or went down), until quite late in the month. Maybe the problems just suited me better.

Day 20 ran very slowly, and Day 10 was initially incredibly slow because I insisted on first doing it with Regexp. I wonder if my solutions would have been feasible with 10-year-old hardware rather than an M1 Mac.

Then we get to Day 19, which was the last problem I finished. You know you're in for a treat when you look at the leaderboard and see that 4 hours was enough to get into top 100 for part 2. The initial (na√Øve) solution (obviously) failed. After a lot of trying out ideas and trying to draw some conclusions from the input, it clicked for me and I solved it. Some hints of the original solution has been left in, but the code to get the answer was created afterward, with inspiration from others' solutions.
